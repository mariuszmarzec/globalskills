# Manul Contracts and Invariants

This document records behavioural contracts that should survive refactors. Implementation details may change; these semantics should not change accidentally.

## 1. GitHub command contract

Supported commands parsed from a `/manul` command are:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `/manul run <task>` | `IMPLEMENT` using the automatic runtime entry point |
| `/manul run --agent <role> <task>` | `IMPLEMENT` using an explicit canonical role |
| `/manul <role> <task>` | `IMPLEMENT` using the explicit-role shorthand |
| `/manul review-fix <prompt>` | `REVIEW_FIX` |
| `/manul continue <answer>` | resume a `blocked_user` task |
| `/manul verify <prompt>` | `VERIFY` |
| `/manul status` | query conversation status |
| `/manul close` | close a conversation |

Without an explicit role, Manul uses `automation.agentRuntime` (default
`openclaw`). With an explicit canonical role, it uses
`automation.roleRuntime` (default `opencode`) and passes the role to the
OpenCode CLI using its native `--agent <role>` option. Agent definitions stay
canonical in `~/.globalskills/agents/`; Manul must not copy them into another
source directory. Unknown/unconfigured roles, and explicit roles configured
with `roleRuntime: "openclaw"`, fail closed rather than silently falling back
to OpenClaw's `main`. This is direct OpenCode CLI routing, not ACP delegation
from OpenClaw.

Routine ambiguity should be resolved by the agent. User input is requested only for a materially important unresolved decision.

A user-decision request is valid only when the agent emits exactly one:
`TASK_NEEDS_USER_BEGIN`
...
`TASK_NEEDS_USER_END`
block, with non-empty content between the markers and no `TASK_DONE`, `TASK_COMPLETED`, or `TASK_FAILED` marker in the same execution output. Malformed or partial blocks are treated as execution failures, not as `blocked_user`.

The decision content should summarize what the agent checked, explain why the remaining uncertainty materially affects correctness or outcome, and present the concrete options or decision required. The agent may recommend an option, but the user's decision remains authoritative. Once the decision point is reached, no further irreversible repository changes are allowed in that execution.

## 2. Task state contract

Core execution states are:

```
queued
  -> running
      -> completed
      -> failed
      -> blocked_user
      -> stale / requeued
```

A `blocked_user` task is terminal-for-now, not a failure. It remains associated with its existing conversation/task context and resumes through `/manul continue <answer>`.

A stale running task is either:
- requeued for another execution attempt, preserving its attempt count; or
- marked failed when the configured maximum attempts has been reached.

## 3. Attempt counting

`attempts` counts actual execution claims.

It increments only on:

```
queued -> running
```

Recovery:

```
running -> queued
```

does not increment attempts.

This prevents watchdog recovery from consuming retry budget by itself.

## 4. Worker ownership and leases

A running task is owned by its worker identity/claim token.

The daemon records and/or refreshes:
- `heartbeatAt`
- `leaseExpiresAt`
- `workerPid`
- `claimToken`

A recovery operation must verify ownership before changing a running task.

Heartbeat/lease recovery must never blindly reset a live task owned by another worker.

## 5. Single source of truth

`manul.db` is the authoritative task state.

Operational files such as:
- PID files;
- heartbeat PID files;
- logs;
- transient task stdout/stderr;
- result artifacts

must not become a second task-state database.

## 6. Concurrency

Task execution is serialized according to the configured concurrency limit.

The default configuration uses:

`maxConcurrentTasks = 1`

Repository locks prevent two tasks from concurrently modifying the same repository workspace.

A task lock/flock is a safety mechanism, not a replacement for SQLite ownership checks. The dispatcher lock descriptor must not be inherited by any long-lived background helper (including heartbeats) or an isolated agent executor or its descendants. Stopping/recovering a task must terminate the complete executor and heartbeat process trees—including descendants that create their own process groups—before the workspace can be reused. PID-file cleanup must not hide a still-running process.

## 7. GitHub comment contract

Every Manul-signed comment ends with exactly one:

`— manul 🐈`

The signature is separated from the body by two newlines.

A result comment additionally contains an invisible deterministic marker:

`<!-- manul-task:<COMMENT_ID>:attempt:<ATTEMPT> -->`

The daemon uses that marker to correlate the result to the exact task execution attempt.

## 8. Result-comment contract

For an agent execution:
- the agent must post exactly one user-facing result comment;
- the result comment must be posted before `TASK_DONE`;
- the comment must contain the exact task/attempt marker;
- if a comment with the exact marker already exists, the agent must update it in place instead of creating a duplicate;
- the final GitHub state must contain exactly one matching result comment for that task/attempt;
- lifecycle comments such as `🔄 working`, `✅ completed`, `❌ failed`, and retry notifications are separate daemon responsibilities.

A `TASK_DONE` without a verified result comment is not accepted as successful completion.

Delivery mode is explicit. `VERIFY` tasks are report-only: successful execution, a verified non-empty result comment with the exact task/attempt marker, and an unchanged repository are sufficient; no branch, commit, or PR is required. `IMPLEMENT` tasks retain branch/commit/PR validation even when status or progress comments have been posted. The presence of a comment alone never selects report-only delivery.

The daemon may verify the final PR identity and repository cleanliness before accepting completion.

## 9. Comment routing

Tasks originating from:
- an issue body;
- an issue/PR conversation comment

receive top-level result/lifecycle feedback on that issue/PR conversation.

Tasks originating from a PR review comment receive feedback as an in-thread reply to that review comment.

Cross-posting a review-thread task into a top-level PR comment is a routing bug.

## 10. Repository workflow

### Issue tasks

Manul first prepares an up-to-date isolated base workspace.

The agent decides whether the task is:
- informational; or
- a repository-change task.

Informational tasks:
- do not modify repository files;
- do not create a task branch;
- answer on GitHub and finish.

Repository-change tasks:
- create a dedicated task branch according to the feature/bugfix branching policy;
- never commit directly to a base/default branch;
- push the task branch;
- deliver changes through a real GitHub PR with a meaningful description immediately after the first push;
- after every later push to a branch with a PR, including checkpoints and review/CI fixes, refresh the same PR description from the cumulative diff and current verification results;
- read back and verify the description and PR identity/head SHA before reporting delivery; stale or unverified description means delivery is incomplete.

### PR review/conversation tasks

When a task comes from an existing PR review/conversation:
- reuse the PR's existing head branch;
- do not create a new unrelated branch;
- update the same PR.

## 11. PR identity

Issue numbers and PR numbers are independent.

A repository-change task is not successfully delivered until the PR has been verified as a real GitHub PR with:
- the expected head branch;
- the expected base branch;
- the concrete GitHub PR URL;
- a non-empty description that matches the cumulative changes and current verification results after the latest push.

The agent must refresh the same PR body after every push (including checkpoints), read it back from GitHub, and confirm the pushed head SHA. `/compare` and `/pull/new` links are not valid completion evidence.

## 12. Source revalidation

Before executing a queued task, Manul may revalidate that its GitHub source still exists and is active.

Examples:
- closed issue -> stale;
- closed PR -> stale;
- resolved/deleted review context -> stale.

A stale source is not treated as a successful task completion.

## 13. Workspace contract

Workspace preparation is part of Manul orchestration.

Workspaces must be isolated per active task and released after task completion/failure/recovery.

Workspace reclamation must use the same liveness/lease semantics as task recovery.

The leased `ws-*` path is the task workspace root. It contains task-scoped repository checkouts under `repos/<owner>/<name>/` and task-local scratch under `tmp/`. The primary checkout path (`WORKDIR`) is passed separately and remains authoritative for branch setup, commits, pushes, PR metadata, dirty-state checks, and completion verification. Manul's shared repository cache (`REPO_DIR`) is an internal clone source and must never appear in the generated agent prompt.

The agent may read/search configured related repository checkouts inside the leased workspace. Those secondary checkouts are read-only by default; only the primary checkout may be modified or delivered unless the user explicitly approves a separate delivery policy for another repository. An unavailable required checkout must be reported as a concrete blocker. Agents must not access sibling workspaces, shared caches, or other Manul runtime state.

## 14. Agent task access boundary

An explicitly authorized operator-side maintenance session running **outside a
Manul-managed task** may inspect read-only logs under `~/.manul/logs/**` to
diagnose runtime failures and may write sanitized evidence under
`/tmp/manul-diagnostics/**`. Do not delegate this workflow to an ordinary
`/manul` worker task; it must never expose credentials or copy secrets into
diagnostic artifacts.

Every generated implementation/review-fix prompt must enforce a least-privilege task boundary, independently of how brief or detailed the user's `/manul` comment is:

- The exact assigned task workspace root is the only local repository-access boundary. The primary checkout (`WORKDIR`) is authoritative for all default repository edits, commits, pushes and PR delivery.
- Related checkouts explicitly listed in the generated prompt may be inspected/searched but are read-only by default. No changes may be delivered from a secondary checkout unless the user has explicitly approved that repository's branch/PR/delivery policy.
- Within `~/.manul/**`, only the exact leased task workspace root and its descendants are permitted. Sibling workspaces, shared repository caches, databases, prompts, logs, adapters, daemon state and runtime artifacts remain prohibited. Also do not read/list/search/probe `~/.agents/**` or `~/.config/opencode/**`.
- Do not follow symlinks or use shell/file/skill tools to reach paths outside the task workspace indirectly.
- Do not inspect Manul task state or runtime artifacts to prove routing/role selection. Those are operator-owned diagnostics collected outside the implementation session.
- Prefer repository-local instructions and skills. Global skills may only be used when their contents are explicitly supplied to the agent as task context; never tell the agent to open a global skill path.
- If a required policy/dependency is genuinely unavailable inside the workspace and was not supplied in context, state the missing input and stop instead of probing protected paths or asking for broader permissions.
- Do not change runtime configuration or permissions to work around this boundary.

### Scope-first investigation and host-system boundary

- Start with the smallest relevant evidence set: the task request, `WORKDIR`, repository-local documentation, source, tests, build/dependency files, and documented project commands. Search narrowly and expand only when a concrete finding shows it is necessary. Do not perform broad host/environment reconnaissance just to understand an ordinary repository task.
- For ordinary implementation, review, and test tasks, host OS/service configuration is out of scope. Do not inspect paths outside the authorized workspace merely because a dependency is unavailable. In particular, do not inspect `/etc/**`, `/var/**`, `/run/**`, `/proc/**`, `/sys/**`, host database configuration such as `/etc/mysql/**`, other users' home directories, or enumerate unrelated host processes/services/containers. The exception is a task that explicitly targets host/system administration and expressly authorizes that access; do not infer such authorization from a generic coding task or a dependency failing to start.
- Repository-declared build/test/dependency commands (including a repository's own documented Docker Compose setup) may be used when required by the task. This does not authorize reading host configuration, probing unrelated services, or starting/stopping host-level services. If the documented project command cannot run, capture its error and report the precise blocker rather than diagnosing the host installation.
- Keep shell/tool calls focused on one diagnostic purpose. Avoid compound commands that mix in-workspace work with unrelated filesystem or system probes.
- After a permission denial, do not retry the same restricted operation through another tool, path, symlink, or reshaped command, and do not ask for broader permissions just to continue routine work. Record the exact denied operation and continue only with independent in-scope work; otherwise report the blocker.
- These restrictions also apply to delegated/subagents. Preserve the same boundary in every delegated task prompt.

These restrictions are part of the default task contract, not requirements that the user must repeat in every GitHub comment. The generated prompt must not contain conflicting instructions that tell the agent to load `~/.agents/**` or inspect private runtime state.

## 14. Watchdog contract

The watchdog is a liveness/recovery mechanism, not a general task scheduler.

It may:
- restart an enabled daemon that is not running;
- remove a stale daemon lock;
- reclaim stale workspaces;
- recover tasks whose heartbeat/lease is stale.

It must not:
- reset healthy running tasks;
- reset all tasks merely because a lock is old;
- create a second independent retry policy.

The daemon also performs a recovery pass at loop startup; this is a deliberate startup safeguard and not a competing retry mechanism.

## 15. User-decision contract

When the agent materially needs user input it must:
1. emit the structured needs-user block;
2. let Manul persist `blocked_user`;
3. stop treating that execution as success/failure;
4. resume the same task context after `/manul continue <answer>`.

Equivalent implementation choices should be resolved by the agent without blocking the user.

## 16. Human and bot modes

The top-level configuration key `mode` selects Manul's GitHub presentation/attribution behavior:

- `bot` is the default and preserves the existing Manul signature, lifecycle/status/error comments, and AI commit attribution.
- `human` suppresses Manul signatures and orchestration lifecycle/status/error comments on GitHub.
- In `human`, when `commentStyle.human.concise` is enabled, the visible result comment should be a short, natural teammate reply and stay within `commentStyle.human.maxLines`; automation-report headings and boilerplate should be avoided.
- In `human`, the agent's actual result comment remains user-facing and is verified using the invisible deterministic task/attempt marker.
- In `human`, commits must not contain an AI `Co-authored-by` trailer.
- Task state, recovery, leases, and local diagnostics remain unchanged; human mode is not a weaker execution or verification mode.

The mode is resolved from `MANUL_MODE` when explicitly provided, otherwise from `.mode`, defaulting to `bot`. Invalid values are rejected.

## 17. Configuration contract

The runtime reads Manul configuration from `MANUL_DIR/config.json`, where `MANUL_DIR` resolves to `~/.manul`.

The example configuration currently defines:
- polling interval;
- allowed users/repositories;
- agent names;
- `automation.agentRuntime` (default `openclaw`) for tasks without an explicit role;
- `automation.roleRuntime` (default `opencode`) for explicitly named canonical roles;
- PR automation;
- rebase behaviour;
- retry/context limits;
- CI-fix limits;
- agent timeout;
- `automation.opencodeMaxStepLimitContinuations` — maximum internal OpenCode
  same-session resumes after step-limit events (default 3, valid range 0..20);
- heartbeat timeout;
- lease timeout;
- maximum attempts;
- lock TTL;
- maximum concurrent tasks.

The location of this configuration is `~/.manul/config.json`. Operator/provider
environment for unattended execution is stored separately in `~/.manul/.env`;
it is not part of the Manul JSON configuration contract. The semantics of
these controls should not change accidentally.

## 18. Runtime boundary

Manul task contracts are runtime-neutral. The daemon never invokes an agent
runtime directly; it calls `AgentExecutionController.execute`, which routes
through `AgentExecutor` to a backend adapter.

Adapters are independent backends behind a single `ProcessRunner.run()`
process boundary. `automation.agentRuntime` (default OpenClaw) selects the
automatic entry point; `automation.roleRuntime` (default OpenCode) selects the
runtime for explicitly named canonical roles. Adapters must not spawn
subprocesses directly and must not depend on each other.

The adapter owns runtime session invocation/resume mechanics. Manul owns the
persisted `processed_comments.session_id` pointer: retain it only when the
current running claim returns `NEEDS_CONTINUATION` with a non-empty session ID,
and clear it on every other result. Session-pointer updates must be scoped to
the active claim token so an expired worker cannot overwrite newer task state.
Clearing the pointer must not delete the task's workspace/context mapping.
This internal continuation is distinct from the user-input flow
`blocked_user` → `/manul continue <answer>`.

For OpenCode, `automation.opencodeMaxStepLimitContinuations` (default `3`,
valid range `0..20`) sets the maximum number of additional same-session
`opencode run --session <id>` invocations the adapter may perform after an
explicit step-limit event. These invocations stay inside the same adapter
execution and Manul task attempt; they do not update task state or increment
the attempt count. The initial call and all internal continuations share one
overall wall-clock timeout. Only a confirmed step-limit event with a known
session is eligible; permission denials, provider/runtime errors, normal stops,
completion/user-input markers, and timeouts must not trigger this retry loop.
When the configured internal budget is exhausted and OpenCode still reports a
step limit, the adapter returns the existing `NEEDS_CONTINUATION` result so
the daemon's existing retry/session handling remains authoritative.

Every adapter failure result should preserve actionable diagnostics in its
`ExecutionResult` when the runtime provides them, including the runtime,
exit code, session ID, duration, error type/message, and the location of any
retained raw runtime log. A generic summary such as "agent exited with code 1"
is not sufficient when the runtime exposes a more specific error.

When a runtime permission policy rejects a tool call, the adapter and lifecycle
comment must report, when present in structured runtime output, the tool name
and permission/resource being requested (for example,
`external_directory (/tmp/**)`). The user-facing retry/failure comment must
include this compact diagnostic rather than only `RUNTIME_PERMISSION_BLOCKED`.
If the operation cannot be identified from captured output, explicitly state
that operation details were unavailable. Never publish raw event payloads,
tool arguments, prompts, file contents, credentials, or entire log excerpts to
GitHub; retain raw runtime logs locally for operator-side inspection.

Per-attempt runtime logs are diagnostic artifacts, not task state. They should
be retained under the Manul task-log directory and cleaned by the normal task
retention policy.

## 19. Clean-break policy

The runtime isolation refactor is a clean break from `~/.openclaw/manul`.

- `MANUL_DIR` resolves to `~/.manul`; there is no fallback and no
  `OPENCLAW_MANUL_DIR` alias.
- Old `~/.openclaw/manul` state or paths are not preserved or migrated.
- No compatibility shims keep obsolete runtime state working.

Behavioural compatibility is required; obsolete filesystem layout
compatibility is not.


## 20. Task-source contract

Manul task sources are configured as `.taskSources[]`. Each enabled source is
an independent provider and is polled during the same cycle.

The provider contract is normalized to:
- `taskSourceType`
- `taskSourceId`
- `taskSourceUrl`
- title/body, timestamps and a normalized `prompt`
- provider-specific `metadata`
- an execution target when the provider can resolve one (currently
  `metadata.repository` for repository-backed execution)

Filtering is provider-owned. The common poller does not impose a universal
trigger or task-selection rule:
- `github_issues` selects issue roots containing the configured `/manul`
  trigger;
- `jira_tasks` selects issues returned by its configured JQL;
- future sources such as Todo may use their own predicates, for example a
  user-sharing filter for `manul@local.ai`.

The task-source identity is the root work item. A pull request, review
comment, or CI check is never a task-source root. Those artifacts may be linked
as context to a task owned by another source.

The default source is `github_issues`. Existing configurations without
`.taskSources` fall back to the legacy `.repositories` array as one GitHub
Issues source.

Multiple enabled sources are independent: a failure in one provider must not
prevent other providers from being polled.

The initial non-GitHub provider is `jira_tasks`. Its REST search endpoint is
configurable (default `/rest/api/2/search`). Authentication uses the
environment variables named by `userEnv` and `passwordEnv` (defaults
`MANUL_JIRA_USER` and `MANUL_JIRA_PASSWORD`), and credential values never
appear in JSON configuration or normalized tasks. A repository mapping can be
provided with `repository` when the Jira task is executed against a known
repository. The provider is disabled by default.

## 21. Unit-test contract

When an implementation task adds or changes unit tests:
- tests must prove the requested behavior, not merely object construction, helper execution, DTO conversion, or property structure;
- the test should execute the real production entry point containing the behavior under test;
- external dependencies may be mocked, but the system under test must remain real;
- interaction-based behavior must be asserted through the real dependency boundary with the requested calls and arguments;
- a test is invalid if it would still pass after the requested production behavior is removed;
- when an existing relevant unit test or test file exists, extend or modify it rather than creating a parallel duplicate unless there is a concrete reason;
- when a review comment names a test location, treat that location as part of the acceptance criteria;
- test-framework or mocking difficulties must not be solved by weakening or removing the behavioral assertion;
- if the intended behavioral test remains blocked after reasonable investigation, use `TASK_NEEDS_USER` when a material design choice is required rather than silently lowering test quality;
- compilation alone is not evidence that the requested behavior is covered.

For `REVIEW_FIX`, the review comment's requested production call, side effect, interaction, or verification is authoritative. Implementation details may differ, but the behavioral contract must remain intact.

## 21. Deployment and executable-entry-point contract

Runtime entry points that Manul invokes directly must remain executable in the canonical checkout. In particular, `agent-task-runner.sh` is launched directly by `setsid` and therefore requires the Git executable mode `100755`. Sourced helper scripts do not require the execute bit. The runtime installer/startup path must preserve or restore the execute bit, and CI must fail when the canonical runner loses it.
## 22. Progress checkpoint contract

For non-trivial repository-change tasks, the agent MUST NOT accumulate all
meaningful work as uncommitted workspace state until the end. After each
logically complete and meaningful milestone, it MUST create a checkpoint commit
and push it to the task branch/PR branch, together with a concise status comment
when useful.

A milestone may include, for example:
- a reproducible regression test that captures the original failure;
- a proven root-cause fix with focused tests passing;
- a separately verified corrective change;
- a regenerated artifact/snapshot after its inputs are known to be correct.

Checkpoint commits are valid even when the overall task is not complete. A checkpoint must not be presented as final completion unless all task acceptance criteria are satisfied.

For existing PR tasks, checkpoint commits must be pushed to the PR's existing head branch. For standalone repository-change tasks, checkpoint commits must be pushed to the task branch.

Workspace-only changes are not considered delivered progress. The agent should distinguish explicitly between:
- local/uncommitted progress;
- committed but unpushed progress;
- pushed progress visible on the GitHub PR.

When a meaningful milestone has been reached, the agent MUST commit and
push it before starting a new high-risk investigation or implementation step.
After the push, the agent MUST verify that the remote branch (and existing PR,
when applicable) points at the pushed commit.

A failed or blocked execution MUST preserve already-pushed checkpoints and,
when safely possible, continue from the latest verified checkpoint rather than
restarting from the original task state. Runtime/LLM failure is not evidence
that repository work made no progress.


## 23. Delivery verification and failure classification

For repository-changing tasks, `TASK_DONE` is not sufficient evidence of delivery. The daemon must distinguish implementation completion from delivery completion and verify the repository/PR state before marking the task `completed`.

For a changed repository the delivery checks are:

1. The agent is on the expected task/PR branch.
2. The working tree has no staged, unstaged, or relevant untracked changes.
3. The changes are committed.
4. When an `origin` remote is available, the task branch exists on `origin` and its SHA matches the local `HEAD`.
5. For an existing PR task, the GitHub PR head branch and head SHA match the expected branch and delivered commit.

Failure codes must be stable and actionable:

- `RUNTIME_PERMISSION_BLOCKED` — runtime rejected a tool call because of a permission boundary.
- `PROVIDER_ERROR` — provider returned a structured runtime/provider error.
- `RUNTIME_FAILURE` — generic runtime execution failure.
- `RUNTIME_TIMEOUT` — runtime execution timed out.
- `TASK_NEEDS_USER` — structured user decision is required.
- `NEEDS_CONTINUATION` — runtime can continue an existing session.
- `DELIVERY_NOT_COMMITTED` — repository changes remain uncommitted when the agent reports completion.
- `DELIVERY_NOT_PUSHED` — committed work is not present on the remote/PR head.
- `WORKSPACE_DIRTY` — workspace contains unexpected residue that is not the agent's intended repository change.
- `VERIFICATION_FAILED` — branch, PR identity, or another required invariant could not be verified.
- `CONTROLLER_ERROR` — execution controller could not construct/return a valid execution result.

A final `completed` state requires the applicable verification checks to pass; a failure classification must not be overwritten by a later generic workspace check.
